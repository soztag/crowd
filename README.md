Crowdwork, or distributed and platform-mediated contract work, is a relatively new form of work, potentially **challenging existing fairness norms**.
Though formally self-employed, crowdworkers expectations of fairness may be deeply shaped by and expressed through traditional labor market institutions such as labor law, unions and compensation, none of which apply to nascent crowdwork.

We study the **subjective expectations** of workers on three german crowdworking platforms specialized on testing, design and microjobs.
Using an exploratory and largely qualitative design, we find dissatisfaction with low and highly variable pay as well as criticism of ambiguous briefings for and intransparent assessment of submitted assignment.

The surveyed contractors appear to be **dissatisfied with the strictly results-based, risky and uneven compensation** of the three platforms, and seem to expect a more effort-based regime as is common in traditional employment.
